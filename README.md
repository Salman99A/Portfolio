# About

This project is my **personal portfolio website** showcasing my work, journey, and skills as a **Full-Stack Developer**.

The website focuses on creating a **unique interactive experience** rather than a traditional static portfolio.

Visitors can explore the portfolio in two ways:

• Through the **neo-brutalist visual website**  
• Through a **developer terminal interface**

The goal was to build something that feels like **a developer’s workspace rather than a normal portfolio page**.
